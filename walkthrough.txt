THERE AREN'T A LOT OF THINGS TO DO IN 
THIS GAME, SO THIS ISN'T A VERY LONG
WALKTHROUGH.

IF YOU HAVE PRINTED THIS WALKTHROUGH ON 
3 X 5 INCH INDEX CARDS, TURN THIS PAGE OVER

IF YOU PRINTED THIS ON A 3 X 5 INDEX CARD
BUT ARE STILL ON PAGE ONE, YOU HAVE ONLY
YOURSELF TO BLAME FOR HAVING INEXPLICABLY
PRINTED THIS OUT IN PORTRAIT ORIENTATION.

I MEAN, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? OK, NOW
TURN IT OVER, I GUESS.

FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE U.S., 3 X 5 INCHES
IS ABOUT 7.5 X 12.7 CM. IN ISO 216 TERMS, 
ABOUT THE CLOSEST STANDARD SIZE WOULD BE 
A7 PAPER, BUT CARD STOCK.

I hope that after all that build-up you won't
be disappointed by the walkthrough itself, which
now follows. Shortcuts are in [brackets].

This is the minimal walkthrough. In fact, I suppose
even really need to talk to the ogre, but I thought
that would be a lot less fun and might leave you
wondering what the whole game was about. Sorry if
that comes across as paternalistic.
